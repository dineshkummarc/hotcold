## About

This project was first created for [2013 April Mozilla Dev Derby](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/announcing-the-winners-of-the-april-2013-dev-derby/). The application and source code was hosted on [Mozilla Demo Studio](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107013950/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/hot-cold-typing) till Mozilla [took down the demo studio](https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2015/12/18/saying-goodbye-to-demo-studio/) site. After that, the project was tweaked a little and moved to this [current home](http://hotcoldtyping.com). The source code of this application is available at this github repository. Feedbacks are greatly appreciated, particularly if you are using this app for learning touch typing.
